3. Solve this problem: When there is only the unicorn image in the <section> the layout breaks. Why?  

  Answer:  I think it has to do with the image being set to float.  My text was actually smaller than the image in that spot....so, my image was flowing out of the section.  I fixed it by setting the height of the h4 style in the style.css to a 25rem and the height of the h4 style in the small.css to a larger height as the image created more space when it aligned to the center.  This works out on both mobile and desktop.

  But...I don't think this is the best way.  I have a feeling a that you were looking for us to use the clearfix that was sitting in the stlye.css.  I played around with changing the floats and displays....but, I couldn't figure out that method.  I'm looking forward to seeing your explanation.
