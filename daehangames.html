			<h1>Daehan Games</h1>

			<h2>
				Hi! My name is Christian.  I'm a teacher living abroad in South Korea.  I've been here for over 10 years.  In my time here I've enjoyed creating classroom games for my students so much that I decided to dip my fingers into making computer games.  I'm labelling my creations under Daehan Games...I chose that because that's my son's first name.
			<p>
				I'm hoping that after this course I'll be able to build a nice website to share information about my future games.
			</p>
			<p>
				Below is a quick peek at my previous and current projects.
			</p>

			<h3>Ballooble</h3>

			<h2>
				Ballooble is the first game I made last year to teach myself how to design and code games.  It's not the best game...it's a little buggy and it can be frustrating to play(oops).  But, through its creation I learned alot and finally publishing it gave me the motivation to start working on a new project.

			    ...ignore those 5 star reviews...just friends and family being kind...and a little sarcastic :P

			<h5>Cursed Shadows</h5>

			<h2>
				This is the new game I just started working on.  It's called
				Cursed Shadows.  I'm trying to make an adventure game with a pop-up book feel that can be played over and over.  I have a long way to go with this one, but I'm happy with the direction I'm going.
