Do your best to complete at least 75%-100% of the project (seriously, don't get too hung up on making it pixel perfect - the goal here is just to move forward with building). 
Make this project your own! Get creative. Use your own images, your own colors. The version that you submit should be your own unique version of the project. You will receive a grade on your code quality + creativity.
